    <h4 class="card-title">Blog 1. How to Obtain Septic Permits in Western North Carolina</h4>
    <p class="card-text">When buying land, it is very important to determine septic suitability while in the due diligence phase. We receive calls and inquiries often from individuals who have been denied by the county or have land that seems to be unsuitable for any kind of septic. To avoid risk in land purchasing, taking the time to have a preliminary evaluation can save a lot of money, effort, and stress.

    Once you have found the property that speaks to you and are in the process of designing your dream home, you will be tasked with obtaining septic and possibly well permits. These permits are the barrier to home construction for any parcel that is not served by the public sewer.
    <br>
    <br>
              
    <b>How do I obtain a septic permit in Western North Carolina?</b> 
    <br>
    Obtaining septic permits are the first step in home construction, or for possible expansion or repair needs, and can be done through either the municipal county health department or through a private option. The most common permit obtained is an “Authorization to Construct” permit, or a CA. This kind of permit allows for the building permit to be pulled and for an installer to begin putting the system in the ground. The other commonly obtained permit is known as an “Improvement Permit” or an IP. This kind of permit is commonly used for real estate transactions and a guarantee that the land in question supports septic and identifies which kind of system, the density of bedrooms, and other details that can be helpful for a potential buyer to know. If the property in question currently has an improvement permit, you will have to obtain an authorization to construct permit before being able to initiate any building plans.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Blog 2. North Carolina Septic System Permitting Updates</h4>
    <p class="card-text">An update on North Carolina Private Septic System Options:

    North Carolina has recently passed two new avenues for obtaining an expedited septic permit.  The first option is Session Law 2022-11. Click here to view the State’s guidance document and/or legislation. This is truly ground breaking legislation as it allows the North Carolina Licensed Soil Scientist to obtain essentially private septic system permits within 10 days of their submittal of a sealed soils report to the local county health department.
              
    Our friends at the general assembly have also provided a private permit route via G.S. 130A -336.2. This statute allows for Authorized Onsite Wastewater Evaluators (AOWE) to design and permit non-engineered septic systems. This permitting route requires the local health departments to issue the permit within 5 days of submittal. The county permit fee is reduced by 70% and the AOWE is required to perform all septic system installation inspections.  LRM is happy and fortunate to have an AOWE certified member on staff! We are one of the few companies in the state that are currently AOWE certified and can provide a private option for those looking for construction permitting in Western North Carolina.
              
    On a side note:
              
    It isn’t sign every day that you see the National Park Service (NPS) on your caller ID! LRM recently had a call from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and enjoyed the opportunity to work for them. We assisted with the permitting of a new septic system for the Balsam Mountain Campground and Heintooga Picnic Area in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
              
    This area on Balsam Mountain is highly trafficked and sees about 50,000 visitors a year and 12,000 annual visitors to the campground. The existing wastewater systems were 70 years old and in need of an update! LRM was able to perform a permit level soils investigation on each of the facilities and guide the NPS in the design of each new system.
              
    This is LRM’s second septic system permitting endeavor for the National Park Service. LRM has previously assisted in permitting multiple system for facilities along the Blue Ridge Parkway. While the NPS is a great client, they are only one of many that we’ve assisted in permitting large scale wastewater systems.  For example, LRM has permitted RV parks, glamping units, tiny homes/yurts, campgrounds (etc.) – as it seems everyone wants to get outdoors and experience what Western North Carolina has to offer.</p>
